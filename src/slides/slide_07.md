## Dynamic web apps

### Client &rarr; Router &rarr; Controller &rarr; Model &rarr; Database &rarr; Controller &rarr; View &rarr; Webpage

The Client's request is routed through the app. The app then responds to the client with rendered content. Dynamic apps can become quite memory intensive with high request volumes or poorly optimized code.
