## Where the magic happens

- The biggest difference between static and dynamic web apps is *when* server-side processing occurs
- Dynamic apps compile responses to web requests on the fly while static sites (that are generated) are fully compiled at deploy time
- Modern full stack solutions borrow static app behavior through "caching" and "precompiling asset" mechanisms
